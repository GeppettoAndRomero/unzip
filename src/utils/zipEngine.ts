/**
 * Read and extract a .zip in the browser, without a server (@zip.js/zip.js).
 *
 * Listing reads only the archive's central directory (the small index every ZIP
 * keeps at the end), so it is fast even for large archives and works on encrypted
 * archives (the index itself is usually not encrypted — only the entry data is).
 * Extraction decompresses one entry at a time into a Blob on demand.
 *
 * Honesty (TOOL-ADAPTATION-PLAYBOOK §B): garbled (non-UTF-8) names are surfaced
 * as such rather than pretending they are fine; encrypted entries are marked
 * locked and are not decrypted here; a malformed archive throws a clear error
 * instead of crashing.
